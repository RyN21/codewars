require 'pry'

def dirReduc(dir)
  # i = 0
  # dir.each do |d|
end

start with i = 0
1 index of 0 and index of 1 and compare the two.
2 delete both if 0 is north or south and 1 is north or south
3 delete both if 0 is north or east and 1 is north or west
4 if they arent == incrament index to look at the next
repeat steps 1-4

we will want to set a limit. repeat process as long as i < dir.length

then return the dir array
