# If we were to set up a Tic-Tac-Toe game, we would want to know whether
# the board's current state is solved, wouldn't we? Our goal is to
# create a function that will check that for us!

# Assume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array, where the
# value is 0 if a spot is empty, 1 if it is an "X", or 2 if it is an "O", like so:

# [[0, 0, 1],
#  [0, 1, 2],
#  [2, 1, 0]]
# We want our function to return:

# -1 if the board is not yet finished (there are empty spots),
# 1 if "X" won,
# 2 if "O" won,
# 0 if it's a cat's game (i.e. a draw).
# You may assume that the board passed in is valid in the context of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
